Summary of the Solution
 The Graduation Readiness Dashboard is a web-based application designed to consolidate key student data, including academic performance and attendance metrics. Administrators can view detailed insights such as:

* Total and subject-specific credits earned relative to graduation requirements.
* At-risk indicators with specific reasons, such as low attendance or insufficient credits.
* Filtering options by school and grade for targeted analysis.

Scalability and Support for Objectives
 This solution is highly scalable due to its modular design and data-driven approach. It is built to integrate seamlessly with existing student databases, with the ability to handle expanding datasets as more schools and students are added. Over time, this system can evolve by incorporating additional risk factors and advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling for early interventions.

Impact on Decision-Making 
By providing real-time access to critical student metrics, this dashboard empowers administrators to:
* Identify at-risk students early and implement focused support measures.
* Monitor school-wide trends in attendance and academic performance.
* Allocate resources effectively to improve graduation readiness.

Next Steps and Support Needed
 To complete and refine this solution, the following support and resources are required:

1. Database Integration: Access to live student data for seamless data synchronization.
2. Stakeholder Collaboration: Input from administrators and counselors to refine filtering options and reporting capabilities.
3. Technical Resources: A dedicated server or hosting platform to deploy the application securely.

Risks and Mitigation

* Data Accuracy: Ensuring all data sources are up-to-date and correctly formatted is critical to the dashboard's reliability. A regular data validation protocol is recommended.
* Adoption Challenges: Staff training and clear documentation will be essential to maximize the system's utility.

This solution is a significant step toward fostering data-driven decision-making and timely interventions to improve student success. I am happy to discuss this further or provide a demonstration.
